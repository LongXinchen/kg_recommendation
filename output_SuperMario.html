<p>Super Mario Adventures is an anthology of comics that ran in Nintendo Power throughout 1992, featuring the characters from Nintendo's Mario series and based loosely on Super Mario World. The series was also serialized in CoroCoro Comic in 1993. Charlie Nozawa, the artist who created the comics, is also known by the pen name Tamakichi Sakura. Kentaro Takekuma was responsible for the story, which follows Mario and Luigi as they attempt to rescue Princess Peach after she is abducted by Bowser with intent to marry her. It marks the second time the Mario universe is developed into a livable place, as the comic was made after Nintendo Comic Systems and before Super Mario RPG. The only other pre-story Mario is within the animated and live action series relating to Donkey Kong. It is notable for its use of the many gameplay devices in the Mario series as elements of everyday life. For example, Mario plays a psychologist and treats the social anxiety of a Boo (a ghost enemy in the video game series that covers its face whenever the player is facing it). When the comic originally ran, it ran alongside a just-as-long serial based on The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Both serials were later reprinted in separate trade paperbacks published at the time of the magazine's fiftieth issue. On August 4, 2016, Nintendo announced that Super Mario Adventures was getting a reprint, to be handled by publisher VIZ Media.</p>

The film was released on May 28, 1993, in the United States by Hollywood Pictures, a film label of The Walt Disney Company. It was a box office bomb, grossing $20.9 million on a $48 million budget. The film was nominated for two Saturn Awards (one for Best Costume, the other for Best Make-up). Despite being critically panned, it has become a cult film, and has spawned a fan-made website, a fan-made sequel comic, and even a Blu-ray release in the United Kingdom.</p>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>: </1i>
<p>Super Mario Bros. is a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo as a pseudo-sequel to the 1983 game, Mario Bros. It was originally released in Japan for the Family Computer on September 13, 1985, and later that year for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America and Europe on May 15, 1987, and Australia later in 1987. It is the first of the Super Mario series of games. In Super Mario Bros., the player controls Mario and in a two-player game, a second player controls Mario's brother Luigi as he travels through the Mushroom Kingdom in order to rescue Princess Toadstool from the antagonist Bowser. In 2005, IGN's poll named the "pioneering" and "highly influential" title as the "greatest game of all time", considering it to have aided in resurrecting the crashed American video game market of the 1980s. The game's mid-1980s release served to further popularize the side-scrolling subgenre of the already popular platform video game genre of the early 1980s. In addition to its definitive features, the game has also sold enormously well, and was the best-selling game of all time for a single platform for approximately three decades at over 40 million units, until Nintendo's Wii Sports took that title. The commercial success of Super Mario Bros. has caused it to be ported to almost every one of Nintendo's major gaming consoles. Nintendo released special red variants of the Wii and Nintendo DSi XL consoles in re-packaged, Mario-themed, limited edition bundles in late 2010 as part of the 25th anniversary of the game's release.</p>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>: </1i>
<p>Super Mario 64 (Japanese: 64 Hepburn: Sp Mario Rokujyon) is a 1996 platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. Along with Pilotwings 64, it was one of the launch titles for the console. It was released in Japan on June 23, 1996, and later in North America, Europe, and Australia. It is the best-selling game on the Nintendo 64, with more than eleven million copies sold. An enhanced remake called Super Mario 64 DS was released for the Nintendo DS in 2004. In the game, Mario explores Princess Peach's castle and must rescue her from Bowser. As one of the earlier three-dimensional (3D) platform games, Super Mario 64 is based on open world playability, degrees of freedom through all three axes in space, and relatively large areas which are composed primarily of true 3D polygons as opposed to only two-dimensional (2D) sprites. The game established a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as Super Mario Bros. did for 2D sidescrolling platformers. In the evolution from two dimensions to three, Super Mario 64 places an emphasis on exploration within vast worlds that require the player to complete multiple diverse missions, in addition to the occasional linear obstacle courses as in traditional platform games. While doing so, it still preserves many gameplay elements and characters of earlier Mario games. The game has left a lasting impression on 3D game design, particularly notable for its use of a dynamic camera system and the implementation of its 360-degree analog control. The title is acclaimed by many critics and fans as one of the greatest and most revolutionary video games of all time.</p>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Kart">Super Mario Kart</a>: </1i>
<p>Super Mario Kart ( Sp Mario Kto) is a 1992 go-kart racing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. The first game of the Mario Kart series, it was launched in Japan on August 27, 1992, in North America on September 1, 1992, and in Europe on January 21, 1993. Selling nine million copies worldwide, the game went on to become the third best selling SNES game of all time. Super Mario Kart was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on June 9, 2009, North America on November 23, 2009, and in Europe on April 2, 2010. Super Mario Kart was re-released again on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on June 19, 2013, Europe on March 27, 2014, and in North America on August 6, 2014. Super Mario Kart was released once more on the New Nintendo 3DS's Virtual Console. In Super Mario Kart, the player takes control of one of eight Mario series characters, each with differing capabilities. In single player mode players can race against computer-controlled characters in multi-race cups over three difficulty levels. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups can be used to gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race against the clock in a Time Trial mode. In multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups or can race against each other one-on-one in Match Race mode. In a third multiplayer mode  Battle Mode  the aim is to defeat the other players by attacking them with power-ups, destroying balloons which surround each kart. Super Mario Kart received positive reviews and was praised for its presentation, innovation and use of Mode 7 graphics. It has been ranked among the best games of all time by several organizations including Edge, IGN, The Age and GameSpot, while Guinness World Records has named it as the top console game ever. It is often credited with creating the kart-racing subgenre of video games, leading other developers to try to duplicate its success. The game is also seen as having been key to expanding the Mario series into non-platforming games. This diversity has led to it becoming the best-selling game franchise of all time. Several sequels to Super Mario Kart have been released, for consoles, handhelds and in arcades, each enjoying critical and commercial success. While some elements have developed throughout the series, the core experience from Super Mario Kart has remained intact.</p>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>: </1i>
<p>Super Mario Galaxy (Japanese:  Hepburn: Sp Mario Gyarakush) is a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii worldwide in November 2007. It is the third 3D game in the Super Mario series and the eighth main instalment overall. The game was re-released as a Nintendo Selects title in 2011, and as a download via the Wii U's eShop in 2015. The story revolves around the protagonist, Mario, who is on a quest to rescue Princess Peach whilst simultaneously saving the universe from Bowser. The levels in the game consist of galaxies filled with minor planets and worlds, with different variations of gravity the central element of gameplay. The concept for the game's use of spherical platforms was first conceptualised from ideas used in Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000. Development of Super Mario Galaxy began after the release of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004, after Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that Nintendo should commission a large-scale Mario game. The game's soundtrack was composed by Mahito Yokota and Koji Kondo, using a symphony orchestra for the first time in the series. The game was a critical and commercial success, having been hailed by critics as one of the greatest video games of all time. Critics praised the game's graphics, gravity mechanics, and setting. It has since won several awards from gaming publications, including multiple "Game of the Year" titles along with a BAFTA. It is listed among the top-rated games on various aggregate sites. The game is the eighth best-selling Wii game worldwide with sales of 12.69 million, as well as the best-selling 3D entry in the Super Mario series. A direct sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2, was released for the Wii in 2010.</p>

Mario must travel across various galaxies to recover the Power Stars in order to travel to the center of the universe and rescue the princess. The game was originally planned as an updated version of Super Mario Galaxy with some modifications and a projected development time of a year; this version would have been called Super Mario Galaxy More. It was later decided that the game was to be developed as a fleshed-out sequel when the development staff continued to build upon the game with dozens of new ideas, and so development time expanded to two and a half years. Among the additions are dynamic environments, new power-ups, and, most notably, the ability to ride Yoshi. Upon its release, Super Mario Galaxy 2 was met with widespread critical acclaim, and is regarded by many to be one of the greatest video games of all time, as well as one of the highest rated video games on the aggregation sites Metacritic and GameRankings.

<p>Super Mario Strikers, known as Mario Smash Football in Europe and Australia, is a five-on-five football (soccer) game developed by Next Level Games for the GameCube. The game was released in Europe and North America in late 2005, and in Japan and Australia in 2006. The game's sequel, Mario Strikers Charged, was also developed by Next Level Games and is available for the Wii. The game's developers had worked on the NHL series before development of Strikers, which served as an influence for the fast-paced and physical nature of the game. Strikers is a sports game incorporating characters and themes from the Mario franchise. The game features the basic aspects and objectives of a football game, although no referees are present and characters can legitimately shove others out of possession of the ball. As in other games such as Mario Power Tennis, the player can use Mario-themed items such as bananas and red shells to hinder the opposition and gain the advantage. Each team's captain can use "Super Strikes" that, if timed accurately, will result in two points scored for the striker's team. Each team comprises a goal keeper, a main Mario character (captain), and three of the same secondary Mario characters known as "side kicks". The game received "generally favorable reviews" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In general, reviewers lauded Strikers' accessibility and multiplayer gameplay, but criticised the lack of gameplay modes and single-player offerings.</p>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BS_Super_Mario_USA_Power_Challenge">BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge</a>: </1i>
<p>BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge ( ) is an ura- or gaiden-version of Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Satellaview system featuring graphical enhancements similar to its Super Mario All-Stars version. It was released in MarchApril 1996 by Nintendo in collaboration with the St.GIGA satellite radio station. Like all Satellaview titles it was released episodically in a number of weekly volumes. The game made use of "SoundLink" narration (radio drama-style streaming voice data intended to guide players through the game and give helpful hints and advice) and broadcast CD-quality music. Due to the nature of SoundLink broadcasts these games were only broadcast to players between 6:00 and 7:00PM on broadcast dates, at which times players could download the game from the Events Plaza on the BS-X application cartridge. A single rerun of the broadcasts was conducted in the same weekly format from June 3, 1996 to June 29, 1996 at 5:00 to 6:00PM. The BS-X download location for the rerun changed to Bagupotamia Temple. While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, new and arranged content has been added. For instance, the BS version newly featured a score counter. Furthermore, at the beginning of the game Mario is the only playable character. Later in the game, time-dependent events occur triggering, among other things, the possibility of using other characters. Another feature unique to the game is the inclusion of gold Mario statues (ten in total for each chapter) that are hidden in various locations (including Sub-Space). Collection of the statues in-game grants the player an extra life and refills the life meter. After clearing a level, the player could press "Select" to see some statistics such as the number of statues, coins, cherries, and mushrooms collected, as well as display which bosses had been defeated. As a 4-volume broadcast, each week bore a different subtitle. The names of the volumes were: 
*  "I, Super Birdo" ( "Atashitachi, Supa Kyasarinzu") 
*  "Tryclyde's Secret Quicksand Surprise" ( "Gabucho Mobikkuri Ryuusa no Himitsu") 
*  "Fryguy on Pack Ice" ( Koori no Umi de Hibobo) 
*  "Wart's Trap, Look Out Mario Brothers" ( Mamu no Wana, Abunau Ahi Mario Burazazu) BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge was never released outside Japan and as with all other Satellaview titles it has never been re-released as a stand-alone title. The game exists today solely in ROM-format and is traded online by Satellaview emulation enthusiasts.</p>

Enhanced remakes were later released on the Super NES in 1993 and the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The game has been re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U consoles. Super Mario Bros. 3 centers on plumbers Mario and Luigi who embark on a quest to save Princess Toadstool and the rulers of seven different kingdoms from the antagonist Bowser and his children, the Koopalings. The player, as Mario or Luigi, is able to defeat enemies by stomping them or using items that bestow magical powers. Mario and Luigi are given a wider range of abilities than in previous Super Mario games, including flying or sliding down slopes. In addition, Super Mario Bros. 3 introduces numerous elements, such as new enemy characters and the use of a world map to transition between levels, that have reappeared in or have influenced subsequent Mario games. Super Mario Bros. 3 is acclaimed by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time. It was a commercial success upon release, which was partly influenced by its promotion in the 1989 film The Wizard. Super Mario Bros. 3 is the third-best-selling NES game, having sold over 17 million copies worldwide. The popularity of the game also inspired a short-lived animated television series.</p>

<p>Super Mario RPG (Japanese:  Hepburn: Sp Mario ru P J), subtitled Legend of the Seven Stars in its North American release, is a role-playing video game developed by Square (now Square Enix) and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was originally released on March 9, 1996, in Japan and on May 13, 1996, in North America. Nintendo ported the game, with minor differences, to the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2008 and to the Wii U's Virtual Console service by late June 2016 to regions around the world. It is the first role-playing video game in the Mario series. The game contains fundamental gameplay similarities and inspirations to other Square role-playing video games, such as the Final Fantasy series, with a story and action-based gameplay derived from the Super Mario Bros. series. The story focuses on Mario and his party as they seek to eliminate the game's main antagonist, Smithy. Smithy has stolen the seven star pieces of Star Road where all the world's inhabitants' wishes become Wish Stars, and Mario must return the pieces so these wishes may again be granted. The game features five permanent playable characters. Super Mario RPG was directed by Yoshihiko Maekawa and Chihiro Fujioka and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto. Yoko Shimomura composed the game's score, which was released on a soundtrack album in Japan shortly after the game's debut. Square did much of the development of Super Mario RPG under direct guidance from producer Shigeru Miyamoto. The game was well-received upon release, praised particularly for its 3D-rendered graphics and humor. The game spawned the Mario RPG series, and two successive RPG-themed spiritual sequels followed: the Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi series, both of which use certain conventions established in the original.</p>

<p>Super Mario World (Japanese:  Hepburn: Sp Mario Wrudo), subtitled Super Mario Bros. 4 (4 Sp Mario Burazzu f) for its original Japanese release, is a 1990 platform video game developed and published by Nintendo as a pack-in launch title for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). Development was handled by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, led by Shigeru Miyamoto, who produced the game. It also features 2D graphics with linear transformations. The game centers on the quest of Mario and Luigi to save Dinosaur Land from Bowser, the series' antagonist. The two brothers must travel across seven worlds to restore order to Dinosaur Land. It built on the gameplay of previous Mario games, introducing new power-ups that augment character abilities, and established conventions that were carried over to future games in the series. Super Mario World marks the first appearance of Yoshi, Mario's dinosaur sidekick and riding mount. Super Mario World was a critical and commercial success, selling over 20 million copies worldwide, and is considered by many critics to be one of the best games ever made. It has been re-released four times, first as part of a combo with Super Mario All-Stars on the SNES in 1993. Secondly, it was released on the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario Advance 2 (2 Sp Mario Adobansu Ts) in 2001 and outside Japan as Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 in 2002 with modified gameplay. The third re-release was for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan in 2006 and in North America and PAL regions in 2007; there were no changes from the original SNES version. It was also released for the Wii U Virtual Console, which integrated Off-TV Play and Miiverse features to the game, as well as on the New Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console.</p>

<p>Super Mario 64 DS (64DS Sp Mario Rokujyon D Esu) is a remake of Super Mario 64 and a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. The game was a launch title for the Nintendo DS, released in North America and Japan in 2004; it was later released in Europe and Australia in 2005. Nintendo, who produced the original version of the game, first displayed the game as a multiplayer demonstration at the 2004 E3 titled Super Mario 64 4. In addition to revised graphics, the remake includes new characters, a multiplayer mode, and several minigames independent of the main adventure. As with the original title, the plot of Super Mario 64 DS centers on rescuing Princess Peach (a.k.a. Princess Toadstool) from Bowser, with slight changes to accommodate the additional characters. Yoshi is the initial protagonist in this version, with Mario, Luigi and Wario as unlockable characters. Overall, the game was critically and commercially successful. It won video game awards, and received positive comments from the gaming press, that focused on elements of the single-player mode. The multiplayer mode and lack of analog controls used in Super Mario 64 were common complaints among reviewers. The game sold well in territories, was ranked on best-selling lists, and, as of September 30, 2015, has sold 11.06 million copies worldwide.</p>

<p>Super Mario Sunshine (Japanese:  Hepburn: Sp Mario Sanshain) is a platform video game developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It was released in Japan in July 2002, in the United States and Canada in August and September 2002 respectively, and in Europe and Australia in October 2002. It is the second Super Mario 3D platformer, following Super Mario 64 in 1996. Super Mario Sunshine's successor is Super Mario Galaxy, which was released for the Wii in 2007.

A villain resembling Mario, known as Shadow Mario, vandalizes the island with graffiti and Mario gets blamed for the mess. Mario is ordered to clean up Isle Delfino, using a device called FLUDD (Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device), while saving Princess Peach from Shadow Mario. Super Mario Sunshine was well received by reviewers. It sold over 5.5 million copies, and was the tenth best-selling game of 2002 in the United States.

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.:_The_Lost_Levels">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a>: </1i>
<p>Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is a 1986 side-scrolling, platformer action game developed and published by Nintendo as the sequel to the 1985 Super Mario Bros. The games are similar in style and gameplay apart from a large increase in difficulty. Like the original, Mario or Luigi venture to rescue the princess from Bowser. Unlike the original, the game has no two-player option and Luigi is differentiated from his twin plumber brother by having less ground friction and higher jump height. The Lost Levels also introduces setbacks like poison mushroom power-ups, counterproductive level warps, and mid-air wind gusts. The main game has 32 levels across eight worlds, followed by five bonus worlds. The Lost Levels was first released in Japan for the Family Computer Disk System as Super Mario Bros. 2 (Japanese:  2) on June 3, 1986, following the success of its predecessor. It was developed by Nintendo R&D4, the team led by Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Nintendo of America considered the game too difficult to sell in North America and instead sold a retrofitted version of Japanese game Doki Doki Panic as its Super Mario Bros. 2. The game was not released in North America until its inclusion (with numerous alterations) on the 1993 Super Nintendo Entertainment System compilation Super Mario All-Stars. It was later ported to the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and Virtual Console (Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U). The game is known for its intense difficulty. Reviewers characterized the game as an extension of the original release, continuing the difficulty progression of its forebear. In this way, some recommended The Lost Levels for those who mastered the original. Video game journalists appreciated the game's challenge in a speedrunning context. The game gave Luigi his first character traits and introduced the poison mushroom power-up, which would be used throughout the Mario franchise. The Lost Levels was the most popular game on the Disk System, for which it sold about 2.5 million copies. In 2014, IGN ranked the game among the bottom of its top 125 Nintendo games.</p>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Land">Super Mario Land</a>: </1i>
<p>Super Mario Land is a 1989 side-scrolling platform video game, the first in the Super Mario Land series, developed and published by Nintendo as a launch title for their Game Boy handheld game console. In gameplay similar to that of the 1985 Super Mario Bros., but resized for the smaller device's screen, the player advances Mario to the end of 12 levels by moving to the right and jumping across platforms to avoid enemies and pitfalls. Unlike other Mario games, Super Mario Land is set in Sarasaland, a new environment depicted in line art, and Mario pursues Princess Daisy. The game introduces two Gradius-style shooter levels. At Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi's request, Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi's Nintendo R&D1 developed a Mario game to sell the new console. It was the first portable version of Mario and the first to be made without Mario creator and Yokoi protg Shigeru Miyamoto. Accordingly, the development team shrunk Mario gameplay elements for the device and used some elements inconsistently from the series. Super Mario Land was expected to showcase the console until Nintendo of America bundled Tetris with new Game Boys. The game launched alongside the Game Boy first in Japan (April 1989) and later worldwide. Super Mario Land was later rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS via Virtual Console in 2011 again as a launch title, which featured some tweaks to the game's presentation. Initial reviews were laudatory. Reviewers were satisfied with the smaller Super Mario Bros., but noted its short length. They considered it among the best of the Game Boy launch titles. The handheld console became an immediate success and Super Mario Land ultimately sold over 18 million copies, more than that of Super Mario Bros. 3. Both contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers praised the game's soundtrack. Later reviews were critical of the compromises made in development and noted Super Mario Land's deviance from series norms. The game begot a series of sequels, including the 1992 Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins and 1994 Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3. The game was included in several top Game Boy game lists and debuted Princess Daisy as a recurring Mario series character.</p>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Land_2:_6_Golden_Coins">Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</a>: </1i>
<p>Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins (2 6 Sp Mario Rando Ts Muttsu no Kinka) is a platforming video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy, and is the sequel to Super Mario Land, also on the Game Boy. It was released in Japan on October 21, 1992, in North America on November 2, 1992, and in Europe on January 28, 1993. Super Mario Land 2 was created by director Hiroji Kiyotake rather than Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. In Super Mario Land 2, the player assumes the role of the protagonist Mario, whose main objective is to reclaim his castle, stolen by the antagonist Wario. However, the magical seal that Wario placed on the castle entrance can only be undone by collecting the six Golden Coins, which are guarded by Wario's henchmen in various locales of Mario Land. Mario's quest thus revolves around retrieving each of the golden coins in order to regain access to his castle and defeat Wario. Super Mario Land 2 is notable for its debut of Wario, who later became the protagonist of the spin-off Wario series starting with the game's sequel, Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3. At 4 megabits, it was one of the largest games on the Game Boy at the time of its release and eight times larger than its predecessor's capacity.</p>

<p>New Super Mario Bros. (New  Ny Sp Mario Burazzu) is a side-scrolling platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. The game was released in North America and Japan in May 2006, and in Australia and Europe in June 2006. It was the first original side-scrolling platform game starring Mario since Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins in 1992, and the first game to be a part of the main Super Mario series since Super Mario Sunshine in 2002. The game's plot is similar to those of other side-scrolling Mario games. New Super Mario Bros. follows Mario as he fights his way through Bowser's henchmen to rescue Princess Peach. Mario has access to several power-ups that help him complete his quest, including the Super Mushroom, the Fire Flower, and the Starman, each giving him unique abilities. While traveling through eight worlds with a total of 80 levels, Mario must defeat Bowser Jr. and Bowser before finally saving Princess Peach. Reviews of the game were very favorable. Praise focused on improvements made to the Mario franchise, while criticism targeted the game's simplicity, and similarity to previous games. New Super Mario Bros. received several honors, including Game of the Month awards from Game Informer and Electronic Gaming Monthly, and Editors' Choice Awards from IGN and GameSpot. In Japan, the game broke the record for the best-selling debut for a Nintendo DS game. Overall, the game has sold 30.80 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling game for the DS, and one of the best-selling video games of all time. Its follow-up, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, is playable with four players simultaneously, and was released in 2009 for the Wii. A direct sequel, New Super Mario Bros. 2, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012, and New Super Mario Bros. U was released as a launch game with the Wii U on November 18, 2012.</p>

<p>Super Mario Bros. 2, released in Japan as Super Mario USA (Japanese: USA, Sp Mario USA), is a 1988 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was first released in North America on October 9, 1988. Super Mario Bros. 2 has been remade or re-released for several video game consoles. The game that became Super Mario Bros. 2 started out as a prototype for a vertically scrolling, two-player, cooperative action game, but later was re-branded into Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panic, a Family Computer Disk System game meant to tie-in with Fuji Television's media technology expo, called Yume Kj (lit. Dream Factory). The characters, enemies, and themes of the game were meant to reflect the mascots and theme of the festival. After Nintendo of America found the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 too difficult and similar to its predecessor, Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panic was improved upon and converted back into a Super Mario Bros. sequel for release outside of Japan. The game became a commercial success, and eventually, the game became well received enough that it was also released in Japan for the Family Computer itself as Super Mario USA. Since its successful sales yield, Super Mario Bros. 2 has been considered a classic Super Mario Bros. game worldwide, including in Japan. It has since been re-released in the Super Mario All-Stars collection, it has been remade as Super Mario Advance for the Game Boy Advance handheld system, and some of its design elements have been included in Super Mario 3D World for the Wii U system.</p>

<p>Super Mario 3D Land (3D Sp Mario Sur D Rando) is a platform game in the Super Mario series developed by Nintendo EAD Tokyo, with development assistance from Brownie Brown, for the Nintendo 3DS.

It was revealed at Nintendo's Keynote Conference during the 2011 Game Developers Conference held in San Francisco. A sequel, titled Super Mario 3D World, was released for the Wii U in 2013. Super Mario 3D Land is unique from other games in the Mario series, as it combines elements from both traditional 2D Mario side-scrolling games and modern free-roaming 3D Mario games. It also introduces new elements into the series, including new power-ups and gameplay mechanics. The main story is similar to previous Super Mario titles, centering on Mario's efforts to rescue Princess Peach, who has been kidnapped by Bowser, utilizing the aid of the Tanooki Suit amongst other power-ups. The game consists of 96 distinct levels allotted among the 16 worlds. The game was released to critical acclaim, with gaming critics praising the amount of creativity and technical design presented within the game, though the utilization of 3D in the gameplay was met with a more polarizing reception. The game was a commercial success, and has sold 10.81 million copies worldwide as of June 30, 2016, making it the fourth best-selling game for the 3DS. It was also the first 3DS game to sell over 5 million copies. Nintendo re-released the game as a downloadable title via Nintendo eShop.
